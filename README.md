- 👋 Hi, I’m @lourenildo-blip
- 👀 I’m interested in geophysical modeling, inversion and processing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming (mainly Matlab/Octave) for classroom development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate at moment on computing geophysical anomalies, small programs in gravity, magnetics, seismics, seismology, gethermy.
- 📫 How to reach me: can be lwbleite@gmail.com 
I just started at GitHub! (September 28, 2022).
<!---I will drag some files, but file.m does not look as supported here; therefore, I have to learn how to print it in pdf.
lourenildo-blip/lourenildo-blip is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
